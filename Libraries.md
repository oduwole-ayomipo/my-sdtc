# Libraries

This section documents the libraries I am familiar with.

## React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React makes it easy to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

### Usage

React is commonly used to build modern web applications, including single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications. You can use React to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application. It follows a component-based architecture, which encourages a modular and structured approach to development.

Example usage:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, React!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
### Installation

To get started with React, you can create a new React project typing  
"npm create-react-app my-app"
into the console, which is a tool that sets up a new React application with all the necessary configurations.
